# Cybersec-Team-Red-DFIR-Blue-Gov Simulation Exercise

The slide presentation deck for the cyber security simulation exercise workshop provides a comprehensive overview of a data breach security incident from multiple perspectives. It begins by simulating the full cycle of a data breach, allowing participants to engage in the role of a threat actor as practiced by the Red Team, showcasing the methods used to compromise sensitive data. Following this, the deck delves into the critical incident handling processes, highlighting the investigative efforts of the Digital Forensic Incident Response (DFIR) Team to analyze the breach and identify vulnerabilities. The Blue Team's role is then explored, focusing on detection and prevention strategies to safeguard against future incidents. Lastly, the Governance Team's responsibility is emphasized, detailing how to adhere to established cyber security frameworks and standards, ensuring a holistic approach to cyber security that incorporates prevention, response, and compliance. This workshop is designed to equip participants with a well-rounded understanding of both offensive and defensive cyber security tactics.
